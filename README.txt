Steps to run the application.

1. When you open the application, it might ask you to share your current location. Hit yes and proceed.
2. At load, the application will show various landmark places near your current location.
3. You will see the following elements on load, on your web page:
	- A google map,
	- Two input boxes for source and destination,
	- Two buttons for sending source and destination addresses,
	- One button to get the route between the source and destination.
4. When you enter data in the source or destination textbox and hit enter, you will be taken to either location, with the searched location marked in black and all other nearby landmarks marked in red.
5. At every new search, the previous markers are deleted, and you get complete new set of markers.
